# 🚖 Bike Ride Request Prediction for Ola/Uber

Predicting ride demand with machine learning to optimize vehicle dispatch, reduce wait times, and improve operational efficiency.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical ride request data for Ola/Uber services and builds predictive models to estimate **ride demand (`count`)** based on temporal, weather, and holiday features.

Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and multiple regression models, the system forecasts how many ride requests can be expected at a given hour and date.

-  **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualizations & EDA  
-  **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models & preprocessing  
-  **RandomForest, Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso** – Baseline & advanced models  
-  **StandardScaler, GridSearchCV** – Feature scaling & hyperparameter tuning

## 📂 Dataset Details

| Feature       | Description                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `datetime`    | Date and time of the request            |
| `season`      | 1 (spring), 2 (summer), 3 (fall), 4 (winter) |
| `holiday`     | Whether the day is a public holiday     |
| `workingday`  | 1 if not weekend or holiday             |
| `weather`     | Weather condition (categorical)         |
| `temp`        | Temperature in Celsius                  |
| `humidity`    | Relative humidity                       |
| `windspeed`   | Wind speed                              |
| `casual`, `registered` | Casual/registered user counts |
| `count`       |  **Target variable** – Total ride requests |

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Extracted `hour`, `day`, `month`, `year` from `datetime`
- Created `am_or_pm`, `weekday`, and `holiday_flag` features
- Visualized patterns in ride demand based on:
  -  Day of week
  -  Hour of the day (AM/PM)
  -  Weather and temperature
  -  Holiday vs Non-holiday

---

## 🔧 Feature Engineering

-  Extracted time-based features
-  Identified weekends and holidays
-  Handled outliers in `windspeed` and `humidity`
-  Removed multicollinear features using correlation heatmaps

## 🧪 Model Training & Evaluation

**Train-Test Split**: 90% training / 10% validation  
**Scaling**: StandardScaler applied to input features

### 📈 Models Evaluated

| Model                  | MAE (Train) | MAE (Validation) |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Linear Regression      | ✅          | ✅               |
| Lasso Regression       | ✅          | ✅               |
| Ridge Regression       | ✅          | ✅               |
| Random Forest Regressor| ✅          | ✅               |

> 🔎 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was used for evaluation. Future improvements include tuning hyperparameters and testing ensemble models like XGBoost.
